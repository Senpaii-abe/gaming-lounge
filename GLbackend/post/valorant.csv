t3_17y4sqf,"What I mean is, when you press inspect and reload buttons quickly.

In CS:GO you can make knives like the karambit spin around your finger, and I'm wondering if the new dual wield knives do this.

Every YouTuber I've seen just pulls out the knife and inspects. Does anyone have footage to show if you can spin the knife?",minecraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/17y4sqf/does_anyone_have_footage_of_the_new_sentinel_of/,self

t3_17y3leh,"In my opinion, Riot is pushing too many agents way too fast and then the agents end up being soâ€¦ C-tier. Like deadlock still feels underpowered. Yeah the characters are unique in their abilities but they are also just meh. And honestly, I donâ€™t see much use for ISO but that might be because I havenâ€™t played the game all that much this act.
