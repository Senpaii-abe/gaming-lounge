t3_17r2bwb,"In his latest [patch run down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pxSxtrcB1w&amp;t=6067s), he is saying in a condescending manner that you can actually type in chat ""Karthus Ult"" instead of pinging it if you want to make your teammate aware of a kill opportunity.

Completely ignoring various complex situations that could arise: 

- You could be in a teamfight in which you do not have the time to type ""Karthus Ult"" while for example chasing, disengaging, anticipating flanks, and so on (you rather want to conveniently press Tab &gt; ping the Ult)

- There are many players who have their chat muted since they do not want to experience the toxicity and blaming that is going on, rather focusing on the game itself (So, how you gonna tell that Karthus to Ult, should I spam my pings in his face so that he certainly won't think that I am flaming him?)

It just shows that Phreak, whom I have nothing against since I think that he gets too much heat just by being a popular figure in the Balance Team, instead of thinking in-depth about the negatives of the ping changes which are stifiling necessary communication in a team game; rather, he is doubling down with such an oversimplified, contemptuous reaction statement towards criticism. 

The player base is not able to properly communicate in a video game that is team based to the core, and instead of creating a safe space for everybody and everything, we should rather find solutions that do not restrict its most crucial communication tools, but rather combat the real issues why there is so much in-game misbehaviour. 

And this boils down to an easy answer that has a very simple, but telling message: 

""I can mute your chat and pings, but I can not mute you from running it down and therefore ruining peoples games"". 

These negative behaviours occur because of the years of neglience towards the issues by not actually barring players from Ranked Mode who run it down, rage quit, intentional feed, and therefore nearly always getting away with it while ruining countless other games along the way. And the only ""revenge"", if you can call it that, is the community then using profane language and abusing communication tools to somehow get their frustration out since for years you guys are not doing anything about it in the first place!","Phreak stating that you can type ""Karthus Ult"" instead of pinging it underlines his sheer oversimplification of the use of communication",leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17r2bwb/phreak_stating_that_you_can_type_karthus_ult/,self,Discussions

t3_17wmnbx,"The Norwegian Consumer Council (who has beaten Nintendo twice the last two years, paving the way for joycon drift repairs and forcing Nintendo to let us cancel preorders*) is highly critical of the new community rules. Quote: ""I have no respect for such restrictions"" from their legal expert.

Basically:
- Nintendo likely can't make new terms like this after their products are sold (""terms that limits the right of usage of the product you've bought must be presented before the time of sale"").
- Nintendo likely can't have these terms anyways because they favour the company (""a one-sided change in how you use your gaming console will quickly fall foul of both the Consumer Sales Act and the Marketing Control Act"").
- Nintendo likely can't stop any modification of their games that does not infringe their trademarks (citing Nintendo v. Galoob (Game Genie), saying there are legitimate needs for mods)
- Nintendo likely can't stop the use of unlicensed controllers (says it hinders people with physical challenges and limits competition in the market)

The NCC say they will discuss the matter with other european consumer bodies and is assessing if this is a matter they must react to ""more systematically"". While Norway is not in the EU, they are a part of the EEC, meaning they share consumer laws with the EU.

*Nintendo has to repair all joy cons with drifting problems, old or new, thanks to the coalition of consumer orgs (including the NCC). The NCC sued Nintendo for not allowing preorder cancellations back in 2018 and won after Nintendo called NCC's interpretation ""untenable"".","Nintendo has already lost twice in court against them in two years, now the new tournament rules attracts attention from the Norwegian Consumer Council: ""We have no respect for such restrictions""",smashbros,https://www.pressfire.no/artikkel/forbrukerradet-vil-ta-opp-nintendos-regler-med-europeiske-forbrukerorganisasjoner,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/2IEXUVmyEaMOOH-9dWxsEyuECVC3wBsEHuw7nTgEJqg.jpg,Discussions

t3_17qlmlz,"**Edit: This giveaway is over. Stay tuned for the next one!**  

Hello everyone! Iâ€™m going to be doing a lot of these this month to clear out a bulk of items I have on an account I used for trading.  

This account isnâ€™t level 100, so Iâ€™m limited to 10 trades a day. But Iâ€™ve been playing on it and Iâ€™m almost there! Iâ€™m saving the bigger trades for when I can do unlimited trades again.  

Future giveaways will start having painted and certified items and full sets. 

Here are the rules:  

- First comment asking for something is the person who gets it. You donâ€™t have to be on right now, I can try to meet up with you at a better time to give you or items once you claim them.  Please do not delete your comment after youâ€™ve claimed.  

- Do not say â€œIâ€™ll take whateverâ€. If someone asks for something specific and you didnâ€™t, they get priority.  

- One item or bundle per person. Getting something in this post will not disqualify you from getting something in a separate post later on.

- You can only claim your item in a comment on this thread, not anywhere else. 


______________________  
**Today, everyone gets a Big Splash. Chose your certification. If you prefer non-cert, no problem, just say so and Iâ€™ll give you that and leave the certs to be claimed by someone else. But Iâ€™ve only get 10 trades a day, so once those are out todayâ€™s giveaway is over. Every Big Splash comes with an unpainted wheel bundle.**

17ewigy,"Hi. I've been wanting to try out competitive in this game for a while now. I'm 18, English, and have actually got quite a lot of hours in this game. But I've only really ever played against bots when I was much younger, done a few casual rounds and a tiny bit of wingman with the one friend I have who plays this game, but that's it.

It's left me in a tricky position of knowing the game quite well, knowing the maps fairly well too, I even have a nice skin collection, but still being absolutely at the very bottom of the unranked barrel.

I'm also not one of these people who deals well with just spontaneously hopping in a comp with 4 random people, who all probably know each other already and are better than me, and integrating with them. Social anxiety and other such bollocks I guess.

What would be ideal is to find 3 or 4 other people who are as new to and as crap at multiplayer as I am, that would be happy to hop on the game whenever, get to know each other, have a laugh and enjoy the game. No strict schedules and training days or anything like the pros do, just a casual fun time in CS.

So anyone else who's new to the game, speaks good English (as to not have a barrier when talking tactics, as I would like to play the comp at least semi seriously), isn't the kind of person who gets toxic and stroppy when they don't win, and is just down to try it out, maybe get good enough to move up through the ranks, and just have a chill time and a laugh whilst we're at it wanna add on steam?",Looking for proper newbies to play with,COUNTER STRIKE,https://www.reddit.com/r/counterstrike/comments/17ewigy/looking_for_proper_newbies_to_play_with/,self,Connect
